Old 3DS help software, sequel to "3DSPal" I wanted to ditch 3DSPal for how horrible I made it, and really a terminal UI? What was I thinking! But here we go, 3DSFraud is a homebrew and Free CIA installer, basically Piracy but for an Old Nintendo Console they don't care about. Modern themed UI, Better Tools, support for 4fr's CIA Library (me) and Ghost eShop, Direct installer next update? Anyways sorry for ditching 3DSPal, but this was needed.
# Fresh Start
Our library is slowly increasing because most of the shit we have, Ghost eShop has too. That won't stop me from trying to expand 4fr's CIA Library. But a fresh start from "cShop" and "3DSPal" is needed. I now have a **REAL** O3DS and want to install CIA's faster so I'll probably use FBI and install them when I download, also I will try to add automatic SD Card support, looking for a "SDMC" SD card. **FOR 3DSFRAUD TO WORK, YOUR SDMC HAS TO BE FAT32**
# New UI
This New UI will be modern-like and no more terminal, pictures will be added soon.
# Users
Yeah, Users! You can upload and share CIA's! A friendly community one might say. You can register and login on client. Our servers **aren't** vulnerable and use a lot of Filters to keep our security up. Happy Sharing!
# Malware Checks
We can't do malware checks, thats why its up to you to be safe. Make sure you don't get bricked!
